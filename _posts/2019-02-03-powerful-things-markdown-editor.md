We don't really understand risks. Schools, Peers, Family teaches us how to either avoid risk or minimize risk. But, I would argue that one of the most important thing that a child could learn is taking the right risks.


## 1. Kelly Criterion
We make our decisions based on risk, risk is evaluated based on the probability of success. Based is probability of success enough?

Kelly Criterion is a concept which states that along with the probability of success, there is one more important concept called the multipler

The multipler is basically how much you win/succedd if you succedd and the same for failing. You don't want to play safe all your life. The right balance between the multipler and probability of success is what we need to learn

## 2. Assymetric Risk
There are two types of risks we can take:
1. Asymmetric Risks
2. Symmetric Risks

Symmetric Risks are the ones where the the upside and the downside are almost same
In Asymmetric Risks, the upside is much greater than the downside

Examples of Asymmetric Oppurtunities: (Source: Naval)

2. Start a company
3. Create a book, podcast, video
4. Create a (software) product
5. Go on many first dates
6. Go to a cocktail party
7. Read a Lindy book
8. Move to a big city
