Maybe its not about becoming something. Maybe its about not becoming something that society wants you to become. Its about discovering something that you truly love, something that you will do even if you keep failing every single day because you are in love with the process, the struggles, the highs and the lows that come with it and not the result.

I want to go back to the time when I could just sit and learn something just because I was curious about it. I want to go back to the time when failing was not a problem. I want to go back to the time when I didn’t need a degree to prove that I have learnt a skill or I am good at something. I want to go back to the time when I could just sit for hours and create something without thinking about making money through it or getting a certificate or getting a raise. That is the time when I truly learned something. Because the only sustainable long term way to do something is to fall in love with the process or learning it.

>  The only way you can be irreplaceable is when your work feels like play to you. That is when you truly grow quicker than anyone else in your field. The opportunities are only low for people who are replaceable.

I realized that as soon as I deviated from that path of learning the process, things seemed much harder, the world seemed much more complex and difficult to face. Maybe its not okay to accept that you are not going to love 8 hours of your day. Maybe its not okay to hate Mondays. Maybe there is a way that you don’t feel like taking a day off, that your work feels like vacation, that everything about it seems exciting.
Define your own Timeline

Maybe its not okay to follow a timeline that society gives you. The timeline in which you have to complete school, complete college, get a degree in the field that has the most “scope”, work at a good company and so on. Maybe that stable, safe life is not safe at all. Maybe that scope changes from time to time and is not sustainable in the future. Maybe its okay to freelance for a while. Maybe its okay to just take a break and figure out what makes sense to you and what you love. Because the sooner you enter the industry, the sooner your definition of how the world works changes, you are told how it works and you just have to follow it. Maybe taking some time and defining that is important.
First Principles Thinking

Maybe its not okay to state that, “this is how the world works”. Maybe no one has figured out how the world works or what life is about. Maybe that’s why there is no right or wrong. Its only about thinking from a lot of angles from all the exposure you have. Keeping that in mind, to progress and grow, a part of your opinion must die with every new evidence that you get. You can just increase the probability of you being right. Maybe its okay to be wrong. Maybe there is no set way on how the world works. So focus on getting more exposure, having an open mind, and be ready to change your opinions as new evidence comes.
Be yourself.

Maybe the point of any art is to express what you feel at that moment. Maybe its not made for everyone to love or like. Its for yourself. Maybe the goal is to reach that point, where you don’t have to prove to anyone, where what anyone thinks of your art doesn’t matter.Maybe being alone is cool. Maybe that does not mean that you are lonely. Maybe its okay to not try and fit in. Maybe its okay to love how you play (Football).

> Its about what you think is right when you have the ball — (best friends advice)

Maybe its okay to be a nerd and to not love things that normal people do. Maybe its okay to think that you can have fun without alcohol and there are much more beautiful things in life to experience other than that. Maybe its okay to find happiness in giving and not taking but not becoming dependent on it. Maybe its about reaching a point where you stop comparing your level to others and the only thing you are comparing is yourself. Then and only then you are playing a different game. A game which no one else is playing.

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” — Theodore Roosevelt

I don’t know if what I am saying in this article is right or wrong (that’s why the ‘Maybe’) but that’s the point!
